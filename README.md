## TIY - Try it yourself

Launch your HTML code online!

**IMPORTANT**: If you are going to deploy it yourself, please do remember to delete line 49 in `/index.html`, which is my personal CNZZ code.

---

Files in `/files` are customizable, for example, if you add a file named `MathjaxExample.html`, you will be able to use it as a preset in `https://path-to-your-TIY/?file=MathjaxExample`, but please be aware that any change in this window WON'T be saved.

If you found any grammar mistake or something, feel free to punch me ðŸ˜‰.
